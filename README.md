Angular Service Worker - How turn your Application into a PWA

Native-like Application Download and Installation is now simpler than ever with the Angular Service Worker and the Angular CLI! The performance benefits that this feature brings to any application (desktop included) are huge and can be added incrementally to a standard PWA in a progressive way. Any application (mobile or not) can benefit from a much faster startup time, and this feature can be made to work out of the box with some intelligent defaults provided by the Angular CLI.

In this project, we cover the following topics:

 - Running and Understanding the PWA Production Build
 - Launching an Angular PWA in Production Mode
 - Deploying a new Application Version, Understanding Version Management
 - One-Click Install with the App Manifest
